# Description

Our final project attempted to use Garmin running data to predict injuries in professional runners. Our motivation was to try to use some of the techniques we learned in class to predict injuries and optimize training for runners based on their training and injury history. As we progressed through the project, we narrowed our scope to one specific problem: determining if a variable in the data impacted overuse injury.
