## Description

Analysis of various Airbnb properties from a dataset publicly available on Kaggle. We identified the neighborhoods with the highest rate of return for potential property managers to invest in and the neighborhoods with the lowest prices for future consumers looking to rent property. We used multiple measures for this analysis and additional datasets, such as the New York City crime statistics.
